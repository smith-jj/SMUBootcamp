### How to Submit Pre-Work

Ultimately, you will be submitting each of the completed assignments in a single folder onto [Bootcampspot-v2.com](http://www.bootcampspot-v2.com/). You will be given access to the site upon enrollment.

Once you gain access, you can use the below instructions as a final submission guide.

1. Create a local folder on your computer titled: PREWORK\_{INITIALS} \(with your initials replacing the stuff in brackets, e.g. "PREWORK\_AFH"\).

2. Inside of the folder create sub-folders for each of the assignments. Your folder should look something like the below.

3. Upon completing each assignment, save your solution into the associated sub-folder of your pre-work folder. In some cases, this will mean copying multiple files into the sub-folder.

4. Then create an account on [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) if you do not already have one.

5. Once you are done with all of the pre-work, utilize the "Folder Upload" button on Google Drive to upload the folder onto Google Drive.

9. Click on the assignment and paste the Google Drive link so your Instructor and TA can review your assignment.
