## Module \#4 - Get Your Mind Right \(Required\)

As every successful person will tell you, "Attitude is everything."

For this reason, as you embark on the challenging endeavor ahead, it's critical that you align your attitudes and expectations with the realities to come. Don't underestimate the amount of mental and emotional discipline this bootcamp will require. Take the time to prepare yourself by reading through the following tips and suggestions.

P.S. Don't breeze through these! They are important!

### Major Keys to Success

### 1. A Little Humility Never Hurt Nobody...

Whether you believe it or not, this bootcamp will be one of the most challenging learning experiences of your life. For most of you, the skills being taught in the program will be fundamentally different from any you've been exposed to before. In fact, your past skills, schooling, and experiences are unlikely to help you become a successful Data Analyst. Instead, in order to succeed, you will need to channel your inner toddler and _learn_ to _learn_ again.

This will be a very challenging identity for many of you to take on. If you've had past academic or career successes in another trade or industry, you may find yourself resisting the idea that you can _fail_ so dramatically at Data Analytics.

Yet, heed this advice now: "A humble learner is the most ready learner." Take each class as a new opportunity to be proven a fool and learn anew. Six months from now, you will marvel at the mastery you gained.

### 2. There is No Data Analytics Pill...

The greatest self-lie you can tell is that any program will teach you to analyze data. Instead, it's important to realize that, in order to succeed, _YOU_ must own your learning experience.

Data Analysis, like any craft, requires diligent effort, constant experimentation, and a relentless desire to self-improve. These characteristics cannot be taught in any classroom. From Day 1 through Day 180 and beyond, remind yourself that YOU are responsible for your ultimate success. We will be here to guide, to encourage, to facilitate, to point out your mistakes, and to show you the path, but it's up to you to put in the effort.

Don't get discouraged! We know you can do it.

### 3. Put in the Hard Hours \(At Least 20 Hours!\)...

According to author Malcolm Gladwell, successful people put in a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate effort to master their craft. As newcomers to the field of Data Analysis, be ready to put in your share of hours.

While the bare minimum to _survive_ this program is 10 hours of outside class time, we've consistently found that those most successful put in closer to 20 hours of outside effort per week. At times, this number might even need to go upwards of 30 or 40 hours per week week during more challenging topics.

Simply said, there is no substitute for long, hard hours.

Consider this time to be an investment in yourself, and know that for every hour you spend, you are guaranteeing yourself a better opportunity after graduation.

### 4. Patience Makes Perfect...

Tied to the previous suggestion is a second piece, often forgotten. Not only will learning to analyze data require many hours, it will also require many months \(and frankly years\) to master. Don't rush success!

For almost all of you, the first few months of the program will be particularly challenging. In fact, for many of you, this period will be one in which you doubt your eventual success through the program. Resist the urge to give in or to become hopeless.

Realize that learning this craft will require consistent effort, which will iteratively build your skills and understanding. What will seem challenging, confusing, and distressing in Week 3—will seem completely second nature by Week 24. Intensity is no _substitute_ for _consistency._

### 5. Not a Spectator Sport...

As every musician, painter, or craftsperson will tell you, one cannot learn a skill by simply reading, watching, or following along. Instead, it requires hours of deliberate practice. In the same way, data analysis, just as any other skill, will require you to step away from the spectator stands and to enter the fray yourself.

Know this now: going to class, watching tutorials, reading articles, or participating in other passive activities will only get you so far. You must spend significant hours actually _working_ to succeed in this bootcamp. As a benchmark, consider spending 70–80% of your outside class time completing data related activities and homework. Only the remaining 20% is for other passive activities.

_But I don't feel ready!_

Often, we've seen that students who struggle the most are the ones most intent on _learning everything_ before they start analyzing data themselves. Unfortunately, this is a recipe for stagnation. You will not be successful in this program unless you force yourself to work through confusion: making errors, chasing them down, and learning from your mistakes.

This bootcamp is a mudslide. There's just no way to avoid getting your hands dirty.

### 6. Crumple the Paper Tiger...

_Am I doing this right...?_

The five most hated words of every instructor.

These words aren't hated because your instructor is unwilling or is unable to help. Rather, they're hated because they suggest that a student is afraid to _try_ something on their own. As you enter the classroom, learn to abolish this phrase from your vocabulary.

Instead, learn to try things on your own, to test what you can, and to do a bit of debugging first. _Then_ turn to your instructor and say, "I tried such and such. It didn't work so I tried such and such. But it still didn't work. What should I try now?"

Notice the change in tone. Instead of timidly asking for assurance, give yourself permission to _just try_.

The best way to fail is on your own terms.

### 7. Find a Squad...

While in this program, make every effort to find friends, to form study groups, and to work together in and out of class. Sometimes, the fastest way to overcome a bug or to understand a challenging concept is to have another pair of eyes or to have another perspective.

### 8. Master the Art of Google Fu...

One of the greatest surprises to students entering the program is the amount of _Googling_ they are asked to do. This isn't because your teacher is lazy or the curriculum is unplanned—far from it!

As every professional Data Analyst will tell you, Data Analysis isn't about _memorization_. Instead, it's about curating bits and pieces of knowledge, scattered across the web and accumulated in various documentations, forums, and QA websites.

To become a good data analyst requires an ability to work through problems and to quickly research solutions ascertained by others. The field is constantly changing and new tools are always on the horizon. As you will find, every good data analyst is a great friend of Google \(and Stack Overflow\).

### 9. Plan Often...

The best first step in _every_ data challenge is to formulate a plan. Break down the complex task in front of you into discrete, bite-size challenges. Once you have a plan, write it out and always refer back to it.

Fundamentally, every task in Data Analysis can and should be, broken into smaller tasks. Don't try to bite off everything at once! You'll get lost in your own mind games.

### 10. Fixing Things Takes Time...

One of the most frustrating aspects to new students of Data Analysis is the sheer amount of time it takes to troubleshoot \(or debug\) issues. At times, it might even feel like _fixing_ an issue is taking 3–4 times as long as conceiving the original solution.

_Know in advance that this is completely normal._

Instead of seeing these spent hours as a _distraction_, learn to see them as a critical part of the learning process. Each bug you pursue is a lengthy lesson that adds to your arsenal of understanding.

### 11. Self-Care is Key...

While we've probably traumatized you with all the talk of challenges, of difficulties, and of effort, we do \_want \_you to take care of yourself. Throughout the program, be sure to sleep, to exercise, and to eat nutritional meals. These moments of self-care are extremely important for your mind to be healthy. Taking breaks is encouraged!

In fact, you will find that that some of the best problem-solving happens during breaks. "Sleeping on a problem" is often a very real solution to your most challenging issues. Try to walk into class each day, ready and refreshed for new learning. We want happy, energized people in our classrooms. Not dead robots.

### 12. Be a stellar student

As a student, we’ll encourage you to collaborate with your classmates, and participate in study groups in and out of the classroom. We’ll ask you to look for examples in the curriculum and online as you’re learning. This is good practice for a Data Analyst as you’ll do the same on the job.

Just make sure you’re doing your own work, and submitting applications you can be proud of. If you feel like you are borrowing too much, reach out to your SSM for guidance.

There’s value in the work you’re doing, it translates to hard skills, and you truly get out what you put into this program.

### 13. You Can Do This!

This last piece of advice is the most important. Remind yourself each day that you _can_ do this. We've seen through many classrooms, students from all backgrounds, experiences, and personal situations persevere and succeed through this program.

During the tough times, dig deep into your own personal motivation and remind yourself why you entered the program. Let this be the fuel that you use to keep on.

You have _everything_ it takes to learn this craft and to gain the opportunities that come with it. It may feel challenging at times, but remind yourself of past challenges you've overcome. Your future self will thank you for all that you endured.
