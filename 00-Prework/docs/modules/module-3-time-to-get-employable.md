### Career Services

Our Career Services team is built on the principle of empowerment. We are here to **empower you** to find a job using the skills you have learned in our program. We can't do the work for you, but we can motivate, guide, and equip you to reach beyond your comfort zone to find the right opportunity for you.

Don't forget that we can only help you based on the information you share with us; the more engaged you are, the more successful you will be!

### What to expect on the job hunt

When transitioning into a new career, a reasonable timeline from starting applications to accepting a company's offer is 30-90 days. You'll spend time preparing your professional narrative and network just as you spend time honing your coding skills.

#### What you DO need to succeed

1. A professional narrative that showcases your strengths & passions.
2. Ability to showcase your previous skills as adding to your value as a technology worker.
3. A friendly demeanor - people hire people they like!
4. Ability to talk about technology - even technology you aren't familiar with - by relating it to concepts you do know. Yes, jargon matters. We need to call it an HTML element, and not a "thing".
5. Practice, practice, practice - the more networking events and interviews you complete, the more prepared you'll be for your next opportunity.

#### What you DON'T need to succeed

1. **"Perfect" looking code.**
   No one's code is perfect! Does it work as expected? You're golden!
2. **Mastering all technologies taught in the course.**
   You'll learn so much in this boot camp, it'll make your head spin. The skill you're really trying to pick up: learning how to teach yourself new technologies using online resources.
3. **Previous coding experience.**
   Many companies will let you learn on the job, and will appreciate the unique skill set you bring to the table.
4. **Every skill listed on the job description.**
   Often, the job description isn't written by anyone familiar with technology, and it can be misleading. Apply anyway! Talk about your strengths, and the ability to learn quickly based on your boot camp performance!
5. **Certificate of completion from the boot camp.**
   Once we've approved your BootCampSpot \(BCS\) career profile - you're ready to start applying! Don't be afraid to start early, practice makes perfect, and you'll only get better the more interviews you complete.
