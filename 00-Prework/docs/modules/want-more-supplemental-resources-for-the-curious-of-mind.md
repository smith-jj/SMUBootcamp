### The Art of Google-Fu

Undoubtedly through your career journey you will have questions, and there may not always be a more experienced person there to help you with the answers. This is why you need some Google-Fu in your life.

Google-Fu is defined as “skill in using search engines \(especially Google\) to quickly find useful information on the internet”. You may be thinking this sounds easy enough... however, there are some "tricks to the trade" that will make your life much easier.

For instance:

* Simple is better than complex - Google searches should be simple but broad enough to bring you the anticipated results. For example “JavaScript remove key from object”.
* Spending time going through to page 10 of a search is not necessarily a waste of time - a search may not always readily give you the answer you are looking for but it may just give you a keyword that will help you get there. Finding these little gems help lead you to the mine.
