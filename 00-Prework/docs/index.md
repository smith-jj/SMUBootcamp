### Welcome!

Congratulations on your acceptance to the Data Program!

You are about to embark on an intense and transformational journey that will dramatically improve your skill set. At times, it will feel challenging, frustrating, and utterly bewildering, but trust us; it _will_ be worth it in the end.

Be warned! This program's curriculum is not easy. You will be exposed to new ideas at breakneck speeds and will be challenged to complete difficult exercises. Be prepared to push yourself and to be pushed.

That said, remember every one of us, behind the scenes, is rooting for you. You were accepted into this program because we believe in your potential to succeed. You will have excellent instructors, dedicated TAs, an extremely rich curriculum, and supportive peers to nudge you forward. If you put in the long hours and hard effort, we're confident you will find the success you're looking for.

### The Importance of Pre-work

Because of the challenging nature of this program, we want you to come ready to _**sprint**_ on Day 1. To help prepare you, we've created a module to be completed before your first day.

Good luck! Have fun! Get pumped!

You are in for an amazing ride.
