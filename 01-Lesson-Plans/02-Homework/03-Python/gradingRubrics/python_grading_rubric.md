# Unit 3 | Assignment - Py Me Up, Charlie

### Statement of completion

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

The deployed assignment utilizes **Python** scripting to analyze 2 of the 4 programming challenges. Both solutions should run without error, producing summary analysis of the selected problems. The source code should also be deployed to **Github** or **Gitlab**.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A, B or C

2. **No, can't test**: Grade will be a D or an  F

3. **Empty Repository**: Grade will be an I

- - -

## A

* Both assignments are completed, no errors on either, programs always works correctly and output is formatted like the example.

* Minor errors or differing formatting, mostly correct analytical approach, logical assumptions made and stated that create a valid, but alternate answer

## B

* Both assignments completed.

* One or Two Major errors, or program functions incorrectly for some inputs. Logic and analysis is mostly on track.

## C

* Both assignments were attempted

* Program has multiple errors preventing code from running, but logic is mostly on track

## D

* Both assignments not attempted or Significant parts of the homework are missing and incorrect.

* Program only functions in very limited cases or not at all

## F

* Homework is non existent or barely attempted.

* Nothing can be tested.

### Empty Repository (I)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the student has still attempted the homework assignment and was unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.

**Good Luck!**
