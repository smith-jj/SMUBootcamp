# Unit 13 | Assignment - Mission to Mars

### Statement of completion

Use your judgment: grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

The deployed assignment consists of 2 parts. The first part of the assignment uses a Jupyter Notebook to scrape various websites for specific data. The second part of the assignment uses all of the scraped data to render a new consolidated HTML page using Flask templating and MongoDB. Both solutions should run without error, producing the correct output. The source code should also be deployed to **Github** or **Gitlab**.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea, can't test**: Grade will be a D or an  F

4. **Empty Repository**: Grade will be an I

### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project isn't deployed to **Github** or **Gitlab**, the student receives a D.

If the student turned in nothing, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade, and invite them to visit office hours for help.

### Empty Repository (I)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the student has still attempted the homework assignment and was unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.

**Good Luck!**
