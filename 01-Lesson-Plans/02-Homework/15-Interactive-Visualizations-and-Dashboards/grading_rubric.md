# Unit 15 | Assignment - Belly Button Biodiversity

## Statement of completion

Use your judgment: grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

The deployed assignment uses Plotly.js to build interactive charts using requests to the Flask API to fetch the data. The solution should run without error, producing the correct output. The source code should also be deployed to **Github** or **Gitlab**.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea; can't test**: Grade will be a D or an  F

4. **Empty Repository**: Grade will be an I

### Yes (A or B)

The student's assignment is pristine: A. Give an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment has several areas for improvement, give a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

The project is nearly incomplete: D.

The student turned in nothing: F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade, and invite them to visit office hours for help.

### Empty Repository (I)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the student has still attempted the homework assignment and was unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.
