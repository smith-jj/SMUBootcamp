1. The solution contains all required sections.
2. The solution contains a summary analysis.
3. The analysis is logically sound.
4. The analysis is clearly written.
5. The visualizations have a professional appearance

### A

* If the assignment meets all or nearly all of the grading criteria, give it an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

### B

* If the student's assignment had several areas for improvement, give a B, and two or three specific pieces of feedback.

### C

* If over half of the assignment is incomplete, give a C, and two or three specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### D

* If only a minimum portion of the homework was attempted, assign a D. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### F

* If the student turned in nothing, the student receives an F.

* Explain why the student received that grade, and invite him or her to visit office hours for help.

### I (Incomplete)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the student has still attempted the homework assignment and was unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete.'
